## Code in the Dark 

To set up your event have a look at the file called  `config/event.tsx` in this file you set up the reference image and the instruction. You can put your images in the public folder.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
### Basic usage

You will be greeted with a form if you access the root of the site. Here the participants can put in there handle and name. They will now be sent to the editor.

### Warning

There has been no consideration about security and a bright person could maybe easily find a way to cheat :)
